# Static React Contact Manager

After downloading this repo, to run this from the command line using bash (make sure you have NodeJS installed):
```bash
npm start
```

This is basically your typical contact manager app that I built to learn how to use react. I will create more advanced versions of this in another repo, but this is just going to get pushed to GitHub pages as a static site. I am using Context API to manage state. Next, I will use Redux, but not here. 

The reason for choosing to build a contact manager app is because it covers all 4 aspects of CRUD; Create, Read, Update, and Delete. As boring as it might sound, it is a great way to learn. 

Some other things to mention:
* For styling, I used bootstrap. 
* Check out the documentation branch to see all my notes as I built this app.
	* If you notice there is no comments in the code, that is because it is all in the documentation
* JSONPlaceholder was used quite heavily in this app. I highly recommend it: [JSONPlaceholder - Fake online REST API for developers](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
	* All of our contact data came from JSONPlaceholder.
	* All of it can be deleted from the contact menu as well as edited
	* You can add your own contacts as well, however you cannot edit your own contacts
	* Since JSONPlaceholder isnâ€™t a real back-end then the manually added contacts are not editable
	* This also caused issues with adding new contacts, but I just created a try/catch to deal with it. 
	* So, the contact just gets added to the DOM, but it is still successfully making the post request to the fake REST API.

If you are having any problems, then go to the `App.js` file and change `HashRouter` to `BrowserRouter`.
Like this: `App.js`
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
// import { HashRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
// Insted, use this:
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Contacts from './components/contacts/Contacts';
import AddContact from './components/contacts/AddContact';
import EditContact from './components/contacts/EditContact';
import Header from './components/layout/Header';
import About from './components/pages/About';
import NotFound from './components/pages/NotFound';
import Test from './components/test/Test';
```
