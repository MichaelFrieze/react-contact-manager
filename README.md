# Static React Contact Manager

After downloading this repo, to run this from the command line using bash (make sure you have NodeJS installed):
```bash
npm start
```

This is basically your typical contact manager app that I built to learn how to use react. I will create more advanced versions of this in another repo, but this is just going to get pushed to GitHub pages as a static site. I am using Context API to manage state. Next, I will use Redux, but not here. 

The reason for choosing to build a contact manager app is because it covers all 4 aspects of CRUD; Create, Read, Update, and Delete. As boring as it might sound, it is a great way to learn. 

Some other features:
* For styling, I just used bootstrap. 
* React Router was used for routing. 
* JSONPlacehold was used quite heavily in this app. I highly recommend it: [JSONPlaceholder - Fake online REST API for developers](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
